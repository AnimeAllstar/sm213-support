# SM213 Syntax Highlighter

> This project was developed for the SM213 language used in CPSC 213, UBC

This extension provides VS Code with the required grammar rules to break your sm213 code into tokens. These tokens are used by VS Code to style your sm213 code accordingly. What does that mean? It means that regardless of the theme you use, VS Code will be able to know what colors to use where using the defined grammar.

## Installation and Usage

You can download the extension from the VS Code marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AsadDhorajiwala.sm213-syntax-highlighter)

 When you open a `.s` file, VS Code should automatically detect and select the extension unless you have another extension installed for assembly files. In that case, you would have to change the [language mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview) by selecting SM213.
